Unofficial terminal client for the ZCode agent runtime.

The official ZCode source is available at
[zai-org/ZCode](https://github.com/zai-org/ZCode), with first-party source under
Apache-2.0 and separate terms for third-party content.

This community client packages the runtime from a pinned ZCode Desktop release,
applies compatibility patches, and supplies a terminal interface based on
[`@earendil-works/pi-tui`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/tui),
running as a Node.js child process in your terminal. The npm package includes
the runtime; installing ZCode Desktop is not required for normal terminal use.
Local development can also extract the runtime from an installed Desktop app.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Z.ai. Its own code is MIT;
bundled upstream content retains its respective licenses. See
[License and attribution](#license-and-attribution).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g zcode-app-cli@latest
zcode
```

On first launch, ZCode creates `~/.zcode/cli/setting.json` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.zcode\cli\setting.json` on Windows) with credential-free
defaults and opens a setup wizard in the TUI. It guides you through the three
model-access paths in [Configuration](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md). Provider settings
and default model selection use the same native `~/.zcode/v2/provider_config.json`
file as ZCode Desktop.
Reopen it anytime with `/setup`; press Esc to skip.

## Host integration

`zcode-app-cli` is designed to run as a normal child process of a terminal host
or agent orchestrator. Hosts such as Herdr and Orca can launch the same
published `zcode` command without depending on private runtime files. The
launcher uses the host terminal without inserting a second PTY, forwards
cancellation signals, preserves the runtime exit status, and exposes a small
set of environment overrides.

See [Host integration](./docs/HOST_INTEGRATION.md) for the versioned contract,
Node.js example, terminal/PTY requirements, and compatibility rules.

## Relationship to the official project

The [official repository](https://github.com/zai-org/ZCode) contains Desktop,
Web, backend services, and the Agent CLI/runtime in `apps/zcode-cli`. It also
contains an official TUI implemented with OpenTUI and React. Follow its README
for official build and installation instructions.

`zcode-app-cli` supplies its own pi-tui interface and npm packaging. Its release
pipeline still extracts compiled Desktop artifacts using
`zcode-runtime.lock.json`; it does not build the newly published source tree.
`vendor/extraction.json` records the artifact origin and local patches. The
public source revision and the extracted release are separate provenance records.

Provider configuration is shared with Desktop by default. Session storage and
feature compatibility depend on the runtime version and configured paths;
sharing providers does not guarantee that every client discovers the same
sessions. See [Configuration](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Install and update

```bash
npm install -g zcode-app-cli@latest
# or
bun add -g zcode-app-cli@latest
```

Using `@latest` is intentional because the App-aligned release format uses a
SemVer prerelease segment such as `3.3.5-2`. The tag always points to the
newest validated App-plus-build release.

Interactive startup checks the npm `latest` tag at most once every 20 hours
per installed version and shows a cached newer version as a non-blocking
update card with the exact install command and release-notes link. CI
environments skip the check automatically. Set `ZCODE_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1`
or `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1` to disable it.

A normal installation requires only Node.js and has no native PTY addon or
postinstall build step.

## Architecture

```text
Node.js npm launcher (config / login / version metadata)
  └─ inherited stdin / stdout / stderr
      └─ official zcode.cjs agent runtime
          └─ local @zcode/tui adapter
              └─ @earendil-works/pi-tui
```

`@zcode/tui` is the interface package loaded by the upstream runtime. During
synchronization this project installs its local implementation from
`packages/zcode-tui`, built on `@earendil-works/pi-tui`. This is separate from
the official OpenTUI implementation in `apps/zcode-cli/packages/tui`.

The official agent, model, session, tool, plugin, MCP, credential store and
provider-configuration logic remains in the extracted runtime. The local
package supplies the missing terminal interface and a narrow macOS callback
bridge for Z.AI's registered Desktop OAuth flow. Node.js starts the public npm
command and remains the compatibility host for the extracted upstream kernel.
The official runtime directly owns raw terminal mode, IME cursor placement and
resize handling; the launcher does not insert a second PTY or relay terminal
bytes.

## Features

**Editor and input.** pi-tui differential rendering with a CJK-aware
multi-line editor; slash-command, unified `@` workspace/Plugin references and
`$` Skill completion; persisted prompt history through ZCode's history API;
`--no-color` and `NO_COLOR` support.

**Streaming and conversation.** Streamed assistant text from official ZCode
session events; `/mode`, `/model`, `/resume`, `/plugins` and other upstream
slash commands; searchable model and reasoning-effort selectors, plus MCP and
workflow panels; status-bar-only Shift+Tab mode cycling
(`build` → `edit` → `yolo`), independent `/plan` toggling with an input-border indicator, Ctrl+N model and empty-prompt Tab effort
cycling; structured session-goal status in the right side of the turn footer;
animated active-turn timer with a static `ZCODE_TUI_REDUCED_MOTION=1`
fallback; responsive context-remaining and session-token metrics.

**Login and permissions.** `/login` setup choices with masked API-key entry,
redacted transcript/history and OAuth waiting state; suspended Z.AI browser
login with terminal restoration and an optional `ZCODE_TUI_LOGIN_CMD`
override; interactive tool-permission approval dialogs.

**Attachments and rich output.** Clipboard image attachments through Ctrl+V
or `/paste-image`, with a keyboard-selectable attachment row; compact tool
execution views with path, command, progress, result and image previews;
parent/child Agent tool trees with resumable subagent metadata and expandable
Prompt/Response details; syntax-highlighted Markdown code blocks with stable
streaming-block rendering; Pierre-style inline diffs with line numbers,
syntax highlighting, word-level changes and CJK wrapping; terminal-native
Mermaid previews with source fallback for unsupported or oversized diagrams.

**Inspection and navigation.** `/diff` browser for current Git changes and
per-turn file changes; `/context` prompt-composition, cache and context-usage
details; `/status` session, runtime, goal, MCP and workspace details;
`/activity` and a task center for background status, output, agent conversations
and recovery; searchable transcript navigation with per-block expansion,
selected-block copying and
`n`/`N` match traversal; persistent active-tool, background-task and open-plan
activity between the transcript and editor.

**Steering, rewind and notifications.** Active-turn steering, cancellation
and error reporting; double-Esc rewind with input-point selection and safe
conversation/workspace scopes; unfocused turn-completion notifications through
terminal-native OSC 9 or BEL, with optional desktop commands; `/copy`,
`/cls`, `/exit`, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D handling with token usage and resume
guidance on exit.

## Workspace integration

### Referencing workspace files

Type `@` at the start of the prompt or after whitespace to open project file
completion. Continue typing a path, use Up/Down to choose a candidate, then
press Tab or Enter to insert it. Selecting a directory lets you continue with
the next path segment.

```text
Explain @README.md
Compare @src/index.ts with @"docs/design notes.md"
```

Suggestions come from the official ZCode runtime, stay inside the current
workspace and exclude common repository metadata and dependency directories.
Paths containing spaces are inserted in the quoted `@"..."` form.

### Referencing plugins

The same `@` picker includes enabled, unambiguous Plugins that expose at least
one Skill, connected MCP server or Subagent. Plugin rows are labelled with an
`@name` and their marketplace. Selecting one inserts the runtime's native
Markdown reference:

```text
Use [@browser-use](plugin://browser-use@zcode-plugins-official) to check this page
```

The terminal editor shows the Markdown source because it has no desktop-style
inline chips. The runtime resolves the link against the active session and
adds only that Plugin's live capabilities as metadata. A Plugin reference does
not install, enable, authorize or force the use of any capability. Disabled,
ambiguous or stale references are ignored by the runtime.

### Invoking skills

Type `$` at the start of the prompt or after whitespace to open the Skill
picker. Continue typing a name, use Up/Down to choose a candidate, then press
Tab or Enter to insert it.

```text
$audit review the current changes
Use $browser-use:control-browser to verify the page
```

The picker uses the official runtime's Skill catalog and inserts plugin Skills
with their qualified names. On submission, exact `$name` matches are converted
into a request that loads each selected Skill through the runtime's `Skill`
tool before carrying out the visible user request. Unknown `$` tokens remain
ordinary prompt text.

Use `@plugin` when the whole Plugin is relevant, including its MCP servers or
Subagents. Use `$plugin:skill` when one exact Skill must be loaded before the
task starts.

Skill and custom-command discovery also works outside the TUI through the
runtime's subcommands, with `--json` for scripts:

```bash
zcode skills list                 # every discovered skill, plugin-qualified
zcode skills inspect <name>       # full description, source path and metadata
zcode commands list               # discovered custom slash commands
zcode commands inspect <name>     # argument hints and resolved body
```

### Active-turn input

While a regular agent turn is running, press `Enter` to send the current text
as same-turn steering. Until the official runtime reaches a safe model-step
boundary, the steer stays in a waiting row next to the editor instead of being
shown as committed conversation history. Once the runtime confirms injection,
the message moves into the transcript at its actual position and uses the normal
user-message `›` prefix. The `↪` marker is reserved for the temporary waiting
row. `Ctrl+C` clears a non-empty editor draft first, including during an active
turn. With an empty editor it cancels the active turn, or exits when idle.

To keep a follow-up editable instead, press `Tab` while the editor contains
text and completion is closed. The input remains in the local next-turn queue.
Queued inputs start in FIFO order after the active turn completes normally.
With an empty editor, press `Alt+Up` or `Shift+Left` to move the most recently
queued input back into the editor. Accepted steers cannot be edited because
they have already been handed to the official runtime, even while the waiting
row is visible; use `Tab` when the text must remain changeable. A steer rejected
or discarded before injection returns to the editable next-turn queue.

### Image attachments

Press `Ctrl+V` or run `/paste-image` to attach an image from the clipboard.
Pending images appear above the editor as complete `[Image #N]` tokens.
Submitting a prompt moves those images into that user turn immediately, so they
are removed from the pending row and cannot leak into the next prompt.

Move the editor cursor to the start of its first line and press `Up`, or run
`/attachments`, to focus the attachment row. While it is focused:

- `Left`/`Right` selects an image;
- `Backspace` or `Delete` removes the selected image and renumbers the rest;
- `Down`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C`, or `Enter` returns to the editor without changing its text.

Run `/attachments clear` to remove every pending image at once. `Ctrl+D`
retains its terminal-standard empty-editor exit and forward-delete behavior.

### Conversation rewind

With an empty editor and no active turn, press `Esc` twice within 800 ms to
open the conversation rewind picker. Choose the user input to return to, review
the available workspace checkpoints, then select one of the available scopes:

- **Conversation only** removes later conversation turns, keeps workspace
  files unchanged, and restores the selected input to the editor;
- **Conversation and workspace** also restores safe checkpointed file changes;
- **Workspace only** restores safe checkpointed files without changing the
  conversation.

The scope picker only offers workspace restoration when the official ZCode
runtime reports a complete safe checkpoint plan. Files changed externally are
not overwritten, and Bash or terminal file mutations are reported as ignored
because they do not have restorable ZCode checkpoints. Press `Esc` in the scope
picker to return to input selection, then `Esc` again to close rewind.

### TUI inspection and navigation

```text
/diff                         browse current and per-turn file changes
/context                      inspect context usage and source composition
/status                       inspect detailed runtime and session status
/rename <title>               rename the current session
/activity                     inspect every active tool and open task
/tasks                        inspect and manage background tasks
/tasks message <id> <text>    send guidance to a running background agent
/tasks resume <id> [text]     resume a stopped or failed background agent
/tasks stop <id>              stop a running background task
/search <text>                search retained transcript blocks
/search next|prev|clear       navigate or close transcript search
/transcript latest            select the latest transcript block
/transcript next|prev|close   navigate or leave transcript selection
/copy                         copy the selected block, or the latest response
/cls                          clear the visible transcript only
```

`/cls` clears what the TUI displays without touching the session. The
runtime's own `/clear` is an alias of `/new` and starts a fresh session, so it
is forwarded to the runtime unchanged.

The task center keeps autonomous task output out of the foreground transcript.
The main conversation receives only compact completion, reply and failure
notices; select the task to inspect its output and task-scoped activity. Agent
tasks can receive messages while running, and the official runtime resumes a
terminal agent from its saved child session when messaged. Bash tasks expose a
reviewable rerun request because a stopped process cannot continue from an
execution checkpoint. Saved final task output remains available after a TUI
restart, with large files limited to their latest 64 KiB. Workflow tasks open
their existing run panel and controls.

Agent calls that finish within one second remain ordinary foreground tools so
their result can feed the current response directly. Longer Agent calls move to
the task center automatically, releasing the foreground turn while they keep
running. Set `subagents.autoBackgroundMs` to a different positive duration, or
to `0` to disable automatic backgrounding. An explicit
`run_in_background: true` still backgrounds an Agent immediately.

While the editor is empty, `Alt+Up` and `Alt+Down` navigate selected transcript
blocks. `Ctrl+O` expands only the selected/search-matched block; without a
selection it toggles all expandable content. During transcript search, `n` and
`N` move to the next and previous match. `Left`/`Right` (or `PageUp` and
`PageDown`) page through an oversized selected block without rendering the
entire message at once. `Esc` leaves search or transcript navigation.

## Plugin management

Built-in Plugins such as Browser Use, Image Search and Skill Creator are seeded
by the official runtime. Existing installed-plugin commands continue to use the
runtime directly:

```bash
zcode plugins list --json
zcode plugins enable <plugin-id>
zcode plugins disable <plugin-id>
zcode plugins uninstall <plugin-id> --force
```

The npm package includes the document, PDF, presentation and spreadsheet skill
Plugins with their original license files. Their bundled skills retain the
upstream personal, educational and non-commercial use terms.
See [Third-party content](./docs/THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT.md).

The npm launcher adds marketplace operations by calling the runtime's public
`app-server` protocol; it does not patch or reimplement the Plugin subsystem.
Run `zcode plugins --help` for the full command list. A typical third-party
installation is:

```bash
zcode plugins discover
zcode plugins marketplace add owner/repository --dry-run
zcode plugins marketplace add owner/repository
zcode plugins describe plugin-name@marketplace-name
zcode plugins install plugin-name@marketplace-name --dry-run
zcode plugins install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Marketplace addition and installation validate first, display the Plugin's
components and dependency closure, and ask for confirmation. Use `--yes` only
for intentional non-interactive execution, `--json` for structured output and
`--scope user|workspace` to choose installation scope. Marketplace Git access
behind a proxy uses `ZCODE_HTTP_PROXY`.

Plugins with configuration can load options from a JSON file without exposing
values in the process argument list:

```bash
zcode plugins configure plugin-name@marketplace-name \
  --options-file ./plugin-options.json --dry-run
zcode plugins configure plugin-name@marketplace-name \
  --options-file ./plugin-options.json
```

Keep files containing secrets private. Install, update, configure, enable and
disable changes apply to new sessions.

### Browser Use in the CLI

The launcher enables the CLI-managed headless Chromium backend by default for
TUI, `--prompt`, `--print` and `--target` sessions. This makes an enabled
`browser-use` Plugin usable from the normal `zcode` command without a separate
startup flag:

```bash
zcode
zcode --prompt \
  'Use $browser-use:control-browser to inspect https://example.com'
```

The explicit `--browser-use=headless` form remains supported, including with
`--browser-executable <path>` when Chromium needs to be selected manually.
The managed backend still requires a usable local Chrome/Chromium executable;
if automatic discovery fails, pass its absolute path with
`--browser-executable`.
The launcher never injects Browser Use into `plugins`, `skills`, `doctor`,
`app-server` or other management commands. Existing sessions must be restarted
before the backend becomes available.

The managed browser is an ephemeral headless context. It does not reuse the
ZCode Desktop in-app browser profile, cookies or login state, so public search
engines may close connections or request verification more often, especially
on VPN, proxy or shared egress IPs. `--browser-executable` only selects the
Chrome/Chromium binary; it does not make the browser headful or persistent.
For general fact finding, avoid forcing Browser Use when a search capability is
available. Use direct page URLs where possible, and use the Desktop in-app
browser for interactive login or verification flows.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.19 or newer;
- macOS, Linux or Windows on x64 or ARM64.

Z.AI browser OAuth currently requires macOS because the registered provider
callback is `zcode://zai-auth/callback`; API-key and custom-provider access work
on every supported platform.

Set `ZCODE_NODE=/absolute/path/to/node` when the desired Node.js executable is
not available on `PATH`.

## Configuration

ZCode reads configuration from `~/.zcode/cli/setting.json` (or
`%USERPROFILE%\.zcode\cli\setting.json` on Windows), with project-level
overrides from `zcode.json` or `.zcode/config.json` in the working directory.
Existing files are never replaced.

Provider settings and the default model are stored in
`~/.zcode/v2/provider_config.json`, shared with ZCode Desktop by default.
Use `ZCODE_PERSONAL_PROVIDER_CONFIG_FILE` for an independent CLI provider file.
`/settings` saves the default model; `/model` changes only the current session.
See [`provider.example.json`](./provider.example.json) for complete field examples
and the [provider configuration reference](./docs/PROVIDER_CONFIG.md) for multimodal
capabilities, native search, token limits, reasoning maps and automatic upstream
updates. The enabled example model inherits the catalog; disabled reference
models demonstrate explicit overrides and manual configuration.
中文文档：[配置说明](./docs/CONFIGURATION.zh-CN.md) ·
[Provider 配置字段参考](./docs/PROVIDER_CONFIG.zh-CN.md)。
The project follows the current upstream runtime and configuration schema.

Three model-access paths are supported: Z.AI OAuth (macOS only), Z.AI/BigModel
Coding Plan API key, or a direct API key with a custom provider. For detailed
setup steps, retries/timeouts, theme, and turn-completion notifications, see
[Configuration](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md).
