# SQLite contention regression (#162 / #163)

The CLI's shared session database uses SQLite WAL. Readers can overlap a writer,
but different CLI processes still serialize writes to this file. After successful
store initialization, each connection now waits up to 10 seconds for a write lock.
Both the synchronous constructor and asynchronous `openStartup()` path apply this
setting **after** migrations finish. Startup migration lock budgets, short busy
waits, backoff, rollback, and failure cleanup are unchanged.

This is a bounded contention mitigation, not unlimited concurrency or a retry of
an entire agent turn. A lock held beyond the budget can still fail. The change
does not migrate historical data or alter the database schema. Do not delete the
database or its WAL/SHM files to work around a lock while processes are using it.

## Reproduce and verify

Use Bun 1.4.1 for building and Node >=22.19.0 for the CLI and storage tests:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run sync:locked
bun run test:node
```

The Node tests use the actual vendored `SqliteSessionStore`, temporary databases,
and independent Node processes. They do not use account credentials or send model
requests. They cover:

- the effective `PRAGMA busy_timeout` after sync open, async startup, and reopen;
- a native session write blocked by another process for 6.5 seconds, longer than
  the previous 5-second timeout, then succeeding exactly once;
- a deliberately shortened timeout that reports `SQLITE_BUSY`, writes no session,
  and permits a later write after the lock is released;
- four independent processes migrating the same fresh database and persisting
  distinct sessions without duplicate migrations or integrity errors;
- killing a writer with uncommitted changes, then reopening without those changes
  and successfully writing another session.

The hold-and-release test needs a separate process: `DatabaseSync` blocks the
calling event loop, so a timer in that same process cannot release the lock.
Each test creates its own database and holder rather than reusing the remainder
of a lock window from a previous measurement.

CI builds and packs once, then tests that exact artifact on Node 22.19.0, 24, and
26 on Linux, plus Node 24 on macOS. Bun's `node:sqlite` compatibility implementation
is not used as a substitute for Node's SQLite driver.

## Follow-up boundary

If real workloads still exceed the wait budget, investigate long transactions and
add bounded retries only at persistence boundaries that can be safely rolled back
and replayed. Never retry a whole agent turn and repeat completed external tools.
Per-session databases or a shared writer service are separate architectural changes
requiring discovery, lifecycle, and migration design. The contention regression
tests also pass against the locked Desktop runtime (observed on the 3.14.0 lock;
the lock now selects 3.14.3 — `zcode-runtime.lock.json`). They do not establish
that sustained high-concurrency workloads are free of contention.
