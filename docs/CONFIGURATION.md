# Configuration

## Prompt Access Preflight

Ordinary TUI input and new headless `--prompt`, `--print`, `-p`, and `--target`
requests diagnose a clearly keyless Z.AI/BigModel Coding Plan configuration
before starting a model turn. The TUI restores rejected input to an empty editor,
or retains it in the follow-up queue without replacing a newer draft. Rejected
queued input keeps its position and metadata; auto-send pauses until user action.
Headless commands exit unsuccessfully with setup instructions.

This is deliberately not a general credentials validator. Custom endpoints,
environment authentication/model overrides, ancestor project configurations,
dotenv files, and resumed headless sessions remain the runtime's responsibility.
Login, setup, help, and other management commands remain available. No credentials
are printed, changed, or tested over the network by this check.

This document covers the detailed model-access configuration for
zcode-app-cli. For installation and basic usage, see the
[main README](../README.md).

## Configuration file location

On first launch, ZCode recursively creates the configuration directory and a
credential-free `config.json` when it is missing. Existing files are never
replaced. The location is `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` on macOS and Linux, and
`%USERPROFILE%\.zcode\cli\config.json` on Windows. Newly created directories
and files use private permissions on POSIX; Windows keeps the current user's
inherited ACLs.

The generated file contains the complete non-secret configuration shape plus
valid Z.AI model metadata, but deliberately omits `apiKey` until one is
configured. This lets the official runtime and TUI start cleanly without
pretending that model access is already configured. Choose one of the
model-access paths below before sending a prompt.

## Automatic model catalog updates

After the TUI is ready, it downloads the official model catalog in the background
and caches it for six hours in `~/.zcode/cli/model-catalog.json`. Startup, including
the first-run wizard, never waits for that request. A first installation starts
with the bundled model list; failed or slow requests leave that list usable.

Opening `/model`, cycling models, or opening **Settings > Model providers** applies
any downloaded catalog and reloads the running session's model registry. These
actions use local data only and never wait for the network. If discovery is still
running, reopen the picker after it finishes. Providers added during first-run
login are included on the next model selection. Saved `model.main` and
`model.lite` are not automatically switched to a new release.

Synchronization only covers existing `anthropic` providers named `zai` or
`bigmodel` using their official Coding Plan API roots. Custom endpoints and
protocols are excluded. Existing names, model IDs (including casing), and user
metadata overrides are preserved. New models include context/output limits,
modalities, and supported Anthropic reasoning-effort mappings.

The adjacent `model-catalog-managed.json` records automatically added entries.
After a successful refresh, an entry missing from both official provider lists
is removed only when it was automatically added, is unchanged, has no catalog
override, and is not selected by `main`, `lite`, or the current session. Bundled
and manually added models are retained because their ownership is unknown.
Offline, invalid, empty, and incomplete responses do not trigger retirement.

Set `ZCODE_DISABLE_MODEL_CATALOG_REFRESH=1` to disable discovery and automatic
configuration changes. `CI=1` also disables them. Requests honor `ZCODE_BASE_URL`
and use a five-second timeout; failures do not interrupt the TUI.

## First-run setup wizard

When the TUI starts while model access has not been set up, a setup wizard
opens automatically. ZCode tracks this with a `setup-pending` marker file next
to `config.json`: it is written when the credential-free default config is
first created, survives non-interactive commands (`zcode plugin list`,
`zcode -p …`, `app-server`, …) so the wizard still appears on the first
interactive TUI start, and is cleared once setup is handled — finishing or
explicitly skipping the wizard, choosing the custom-provider help entry,
deferring the post-import sign-in, or configuring model access by any other
means (`zcode login`, a hand-edited `config.json`), in which case the wizard
does not appear at all. The marker is only kept when login or the desktop
import was attempted and failed, so an unconfigured user is guided again on
the next start. Press Esc to skip the wizard. It can be reopened anytime with
`/setup`, and it never appears for an existing configuration unless invoked
manually.

### Importing settings from the ZCode desktop app

The desktop import copies the selected desktop provider family (Z.AI or
BigModel): provider name, `baseURL`, and the desktop model list (merged into
the existing models, desktop IDs first). `model.main` keeps the current
selection when the model ID exists on both sides (case-insensitively),
otherwise it falls back to the first available of `glm-5.2`/`glm-5.3` (or the
desktop list's first model); `model.lite` falls back to `glm-5-turbo` and then
to the selected main model, so both selections always reference models that
exist after the import. A backup of the pre-import `config.json` is written
next to it as `config.json.pre-migration.bak`; if the backup cannot be
written, the import is aborted before any change is made.

Desktop credentials are never copied: the desktop app stores them encrypted
(`enc:v1:`) with a key held by the desktop process, and the CLI reads desktop
files only. After importing, sign in once via the offered login step (or
`/login` later) so a fresh Coding Plan API key lands in the CLI config. An
existing CLI-side `apiKey` for the same provider is always preserved.

## Model-access paths

Three model-access paths are supported:

- **Z.AI OAuth on macOS**: run `zcode login` when no provider is configured, or
  `zcode login --oauth` to force reauthorization; add `--no-browser` to print
  the authorization URL instead of opening a browser (useful over SSH);
- **Z.AI/BigModel Coding Plan API key**: open `/login` in the TUI and choose the
  matching masked API-key option;
- **Direct API key with a custom provider**: use the
  [`config.example.json`](../config.example.json) template and do not log in.

When `model.main` already resolves to a configured provider/model with an
inline API key, plain `zcode login` exits successfully and explains that OAuth
is unnecessary. This prevents a custom provider from being replaced by an
unrelated login flow.

### Coding Plan API key

Start the TUI and open its setup picker:

```text
/login
```

Choose either **Z.AI Coding Plan API Key** or **BigModel Coding Plan API Key**,
then paste the key into the masked prompt. The raw key is sent only to the
official runtime's `configureCodingPlanApiKey` implementation. The local TUI
does not add it to editor history or the visible/session transcript, and error
messages are redacted before rendering.

The same picker includes a **Custom provider** entry that points to the
configuration-template path below. Custom providers do not use OAuth.

Selecting **Z.AI Coding Plan** releases TUI raw mode and starts the registered
Desktop authorization-code flow. On macOS the CLI temporarily installs a
background-only callback receiver, verifies the returned `state`, restores the
previous `zcode://` handler, and hands the callback to the official runtime.
The authorization code travels over stdin instead of command-line arguments or
environment variables. The runtime performs token exchange, encrypted
credential persistence, Coding Plan API-key resolution and `config.json`
updates. The TUI is then restored and the model configuration is re-read.

The callback receiver is removed after success, cancellation or timeout. A
small recovery record lets the next login restore the previous handler after
an unclean process exit. The BigModel option continues to use the official
localhost-callback implementation inside the runtime.

### Custom provider without login

Start `zcode` once to generate the full user configuration automatically. From
a source checkout, `config.example.json` contains the same initial structure
for reference. Then edit the generated file:

```bash
zcode
```

Edit these four areas in `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` (or the Windows path shown
above):

1. `provider.zai.kind`: use `anthropic`, `openai-compatible`, or `openai`;
2. `provider.zai.options.baseURL`: use the provider's API root;
3. `provider.zai.options.apiKey`: insert the direct API key;
4. replace the entries in `provider.zai.models`, then point both `model.main`
   and `model.lite` at the desired model IDs.

The provider map key is deliberately `zai`. The upstream CLI 0.15.x TUI
considers a direct API key configured only when it is stored under provider ID
`zai` or `bigmodel`. An arbitrary provider ID is valid model configuration,
but as the only provider it still triggers the upstream login gate. The
display name, API format, endpoint, headers and models remain fully custom.

For an Anthropic-compatible endpoint:

```json
{
  "kind": "anthropic",
  "options": {
    "baseURL": "https://example.com/api/anthropic",
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "apiKeyRequired": true
  }
}
```

Use the API root, not a final `/messages` path. For an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint, set `kind` to `openai-compatible` and normally use a root ending in
`/v1`, not `/chat/completions`. For the official OpenAI API, use `openai`;
`baseURL` can be omitted.

The object keys form the runtime model reference:

```text
provider.<provider-id>.models.<model-id>
                    -> <provider-id>/<model-id>
```

Set both roles to keep all work on the custom provider:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "main": "zai/your-model-id",
    "lite": "zai/your-model-id"
  }
}
```

`main` is the normal conversation model. `lite` is used for lightweight and
subagent work. Model IDs are case-sensitive and must match the endpoint.

Built-in subagent model overrides saved by the ZCode desktop app in
`<storage.dir>/v2/agents-state.json` (`builtInModelOverrides`) supersede `lite`
for those subagents. Refs such as `custom:builtin%3Azai-coding-plan:GLM-5.3-Flash`
name a desktop provider id that this config never registers, so the runtime
resolves `builtin:zai-coding-plan` onto your configured `zai` provider (and
`builtin:bigmodel-coding-plan` onto `bigmodel`). The override's model id is sent
as written. To change which model those subagents use, change the override in
the desktop app; `model.lite` does not apply to them.

The no-login TUI path currently requires a non-empty `options.apiKey` in the
local config; an environment-only API key does not satisfy the upstream login
gate. Never commit the populated file, and keep its mode at `600`.

### Adding a multimodal model

Each entry under `provider.<id>.models.<model-id>` is a catalog record. The
runtime reads these optional fields to decide whether a model accepts image,
PDF, or video input:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modalities.input` | string[] | Enumerated input modalities: `text`, `audio`, `image`, `video`, `pdf`. Image, PDF, and video support are derived from this list. |
| `modalities.output` | string[] | Enumerated output modalities (usually `["text"]`). |
| `limit.context` | number | Context window in tokens. |
| `limit.output` | number | Max output tokens. |

Listing `"image"` under `modalities.input` is all that is needed to enable
image attachments — the runtime derives the capability gates from the input
list, so no separate capability flags are required.

To add `glm-5.3-flash` as a multimodal model under the `zai` provider:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "zai": {
      "kind": "anthropic",
      "name": "Z.AI Coding Plan",
      "options": {
        "apiKeyRequired": true,
        "baseURL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic"
      },
      "headers": {},
      "models": {
        "glm-5.3-flash": {
          "name": "GLM-5.3-Flash",
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "video"],
            "output": ["text"]
          },
          "limit": { "context": 1000000, "output": 128000 }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "model": {
    "main": "zai/glm-5.3-flash",
    "lite": "zai/glm-5-turbo"
  }
}
```

Then point `model.main` (and optionally `model.lite`) at the new id. The
`model` block stays strict — only `main` and `lite` are accepted; multimodal
capability is declared in the provider catalog entry above, never inside
`model`.

After saving, verify the picker sees the capability:

```text
/model   # should list zai/glm-5.3-flash with image input enabled
```

Attach an image from the clipboard with `Ctrl+V` or `/paste-image`; pending
images appear as `[Image #N]` tokens above the editor and are sent with the
next prompt. The runtime silently drops image blocks for models whose
`modalities.input` does not include `image`, so a vision model is required to
actually send the attachment upstream.

### Using the custom provider

After saving the config, no login command is required. Start the client:

```bash
zcode
```

From a source checkout, use `bun run dev` instead (see
[Development](./DEVELOPMENT.md)).

Use these commands inside the TUI:

```text
/model                         # show the active and available models
/model zai/your-model-id       # switch to the custom provider explicitly
/new                           # start a new session with the configured default
```

The status line should show `zai/your-model-id`. Setting both `model.main` and
`model.lite` in the config makes the custom provider the default for normal,
lightweight and subagent work. A resumed session may retain its previous model,
so use `/new` after changing the default.

Headless prompts use the same provider configuration:

```bash
zcode --prompt "Explain this repository"
```

Project-level overrides are read from `zcode.json` or `.zcode/config.json` in
the working directory. Running `/model` does not call the provider, so it is a
safe configuration check before the first prompt.

### Background agents

Long-running Agent calls automatically detach from the foreground turn after
one second and remain available through `/tasks`. Short Agent calls stay inline
so the current response can use their result without a notification round trip.
Configure the threshold in milliseconds:

```json
{
  "subagents": {
    "autoBackgroundMs": 1000
  }
}
```

Set the value to `0` to disable automatic backgrounding. Agent tool calls that
use `run_in_background: true` detach immediately regardless of this threshold.

### Request retries and stalled streams

The CLI leaves retry classification and execution to the official ZCode
runtime. It supplies a default retry budget of five retries; override it when
needed with the runtime's own environment variable:

```bash
ZCODE_MODEL_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES=3 zcode
```

Newly generated configs use a 60-second model-stream idle timeout:

```json
{
  "modelStream": {
    "idleTimeoutMs": 60000
  }
}
```

Existing configs are never overwritten, so update this field manually if an
older generated file still contains `600000`. Retryable timeouts, dropped
streams, rate limits and server/network errors are retried and shown in the
TUI. Authentication and invalid-request responses remain non-retryable.

## Runtime diagnostics

The interactive TUI captures runtime `stderr` so background diagnostics cannot
overwrite terminal rendering. A non-zero runtime exit prints its status and the
diagnostic path after the TUI stops. The active log is capped at 2 MB and rotated
to `.1` on the next launch; both files use owner-only permissions.

The default path is `~/.zcode/cli/tui-runtime.log`. Override it when collecting
diagnostics in an isolated environment:

```bash
ZCODE_TUI_RUNTIME_LOG=/tmp/zcode-tui-runtime.log zcode
```

## TUI display mode

The interactive TUI uses regular scrollback output by default. Set
`ui.tuiMode` to `"fullscreen"` to use the terminal's alternate screen with an
independently scrollable transcript, a fixed composer, and mouse-wheel/
scrollbar navigation. The composer remains available while older transcript
content is being reviewed. The scrollbar is hidden when the transcript fits,
then appears briefly while scrolling and follows the active dark/light theme.

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "tuiMode": "fullscreen"
  }
}
```

The same setting can be changed from `/settings` (or `/config`) under **Display
mode**. `ZCODE_TUI_MODE=fullscreen` or `ZCODE_TUI_MODE=regular` temporarily
overrides the saved value for the current shell; the settings picker labels
this override and does not remove it.

Fullscreen mode is restored on normal exit and on handled `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`,
or `SIGHUP` shutdowns. A hard `SIGKILL` cannot be intercepted by any terminal
application.

### Copy on select

Releasing a mouse selection in fullscreen mode copies the selected text to the
system clipboard. Set `ui.copyOnSelect` to `false` to keep copying manual:
drags then only highlight, and the terminal's native selection (hold Shift or
the modifier your emulator documents while dragging) still works. The setting
only affects fullscreen mode; regular scrollback mode has no mouse selection.
The same toggle is available in `/settings` under **Fullscreen copy on
select**.

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "copyOnSelect": false
  }
}
```

## Theme

Set `ui.theme` to `"auto"` (terminal detection), `"dark"`, or `"light"` in the
user config: `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` on macOS/Linux or
`%USERPROFILE%\.zcode\cli\config.json` on Windows. An explicit dark/light value
takes priority over terminal probing. `auto` queries the terminal background
color and color scheme at startup and re-applies the matching palette.

## Turn completion notifications

Notifications are enabled by default and emitted after a normal agent turn
completes or fails while the terminal is unfocused. Following Codex's terminal
capability fallback, `auto` uses OSC 9 in Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, Warp and
WezTerm, and BEL in terminals such as Apple Terminal. Selecting OSC 9 in an
unsupported terminal also falls back to BEL instead of silently emitting an
ignored sequence.

The `unfocused` condition uses DEC focus reporting when the terminal provides
it. Until focus support is confirmed, ZCode sends the notification instead of
permanently suppressing it as focused. `native` is an explicit opt-in that uses
an existing system command: `terminal-notifier` on macOS, `notify-send` on
Linux, or `SnoreToast` on Windows. These tools are not bundled, keeping the
default terminal notification path dependency-free. If the selected command is
unavailable or delivery fails, ZCode falls back to BEL. On macOS, the detected
terminal application is used as both the sender and click target. Exact tab or
pane restoration remains terminal-dependent; use the default `auto` setting so
OSC-capable terminals can preserve their native session behavior.

Open the interactive settings picker inside the TUI (both commands are
equivalent):

```text
/config
/settings
```

Saving a value returns to the settings root so several options can be changed
in one visit. `Esc` returns from a setting to the root, then closes the root.

The picker updates the active session immediately and persists the selected
values under `ui.notifications` in the cross-platform user `config.json`:

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "notifications": {
      "method": "auto",
      "condition": "unfocused"
    }
  }
}
```

Environment variables override `config.json` on startup and are useful for a
temporary per-shell setting:

```bash
export ZCODE_TUI_NOTIFICATION_METHOD=auto       # auto|osc9|bel|native|off
export ZCODE_TUI_NOTIFICATION_CONDITION=always  # unfocused|always
zcode
```

## Official MCP Availability

When the bundled runtime has no official MCP trusted-origin registry, official
HTTP MCP services are reported as disabled with an `official_auth_unavailable`
diagnostic. Other plugin components remain available. This does not disable
certificate, origin, or permission checks, and does not suppress services when
the runtime provides the required registry. No user configuration is rewritten.

## Registering a local or dev MCP server or plugin

Nothing else in this repository's docs covers how to connect a local or
in-development MCP server (or plugin) to ZCode. This section documents both
supported paths, verified end to end this session against ZCode 3.11.2-25 by
reverse-engineering the bundled runtime (`vendor/zcode.cjs`) and confirming
behavior live in the TUI.

### Direct MCP server registration

The fastest path — and, per the known limitation below, currently the only
path that works for a server needing a real secret — is registering the
server directly under the `mcp.servers` key in `config.json`. No plugin,
marketplace, or trust system is involved:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "my-server-name": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:PORT/path",
        "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The config loader reads this key from either the global config
(`~/.zcode/cli/config.json`, see "Configuration file location" above) or a
project-level config file — `zcode.json` or `.zcode/config.json` — found by
walking up from the current working directory to the nearest `.git`
ancestor. This is the same project-override mechanism already used for
provider and model settings (see "Using the custom provider" above); an
`mcp.servers` entry works the same way at either level.

Verified this session end to end: adding an entry this way made the server
show up in the TUI's `/mcp` panel as `connected · http · N tools`, and it
was genuinely callable by name from a live task after starting (or
restarting) `zcode`.

### Plugin marketplace install path

ZCode also supports installing an MCP server bundled inside a plugin, via a
local marketplace:

```bash
zcode plugins marketplace add <local-dir-with-marketplace.json> --yes --json
zcode plugins install <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name> --yes --json
```

The exact shape required for both files is exercised end to end by
`test/runtime/launcher.test.ts`'s `"adds a local marketplace and installs
its Plugin end to end"` test (around lines 267-336); read that test for the
authoritative, currently-passing example. Its `marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "cli-smoke-marketplace",
  "pluginRoot": ".",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "description": "CLI smoke plugin",
      "name": "cli-smoke-plugin",
      "source": "./plugin",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

And the plugin's own `.zcode-plugin/plugin.json`, at the path named by
`plugins[].source` relative to `pluginRoot`:

```json
{
  "description": "CLI smoke plugin",
  "name": "cli-smoke-plugin",
  "skills": "skills",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

`skills` names a directory, relative to the plugin root, containing one
subdirectory per skill, each with its own `SKILL.md`. The same
`.zcode-plugin/` layout is where a plugin's own `.mcp.json` (its bundled MCP
server definitions) lives.

#### Known limitation: install fails for any `.mcp.json` with a plain env var

Confirmed this session: `zcode plugins install` fails with

```json
{
  "code": "plugin_variable_missing",
  "message": "Missing environment variable: <VAR>",
  "severity": "error"
}
```

for **any** plugin whose `.mcp.json` references a plain, non-`user_config.*`
placeholder — `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` — even when that variable is genuinely set
in the process environment, and even for `ZCODE_`-prefixed names that do not
require `allowSensitive`. Root cause, found by reading the bundled runtime:
the plugin-diagnostics preflight (function `Y4o` in this build) hardcodes an
empty object (`env: {}`) as the substitution context for that check,
regardless of the real process environment. This is a confirmed bug in the
vendored runtime, not a mistake in the plugin author's `.mcp.json`.

**Practical consequence:** any plugin whose `.mcp.json` needs a
bearer-token or other secret environment variable cannot currently be
installed via `zcode plugins install` on this ZCode build (3.11.2-25) at
all. Until the runtime is patched, use the direct `mcp.servers`
registration path above instead — it has no such preflight and works for
servers needing real secrets today.
