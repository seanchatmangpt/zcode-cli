# Releasing zcode-app-cli

Each release follows the current upstream runtime and provider schema. The lock
file records the verified installer for reproducible builds; it is not a promise
to support older runtime versions.

This document covers the maintainer-only workflows for synchronizing the
upstream runtime, building the npm tarball, and publishing releases. End users
do not need any of this — see the [main README](../README.md) for installation
and usage.

## Remote extraction

The same path used by CI can be run locally:

```bash
brew install sevenzip
bun run sync -- --platform linux --arch x64
```

Use the committed artifact instead of the latest updater manifest when
rebuilding a reviewed release:

```bash
bun run sync:locked
```

### Local app extraction

`bun run sync:local` extracts the runtime from a locally installed ZCode.app
(`$HOME/Applications/ZCode.app`) instead of downloading the manifest installer:

```bash
bun run sync:local
```

It applies the same patch plan and capability extraction and records the
provenance in `vendor/extraction.json`: the source application path (`source`),
the Desktop `appVersion` and the official runtime `cliVersion` (the current
sync records `3.14.3` / `0.16.9`), the extraction timestamp and each patch
result. A local sync never rewrites `package.json` or
`zcode-runtime.lock.json`: the lock keeps pinning the exact remote installer
that published releases reproduce. When the local app is newer than the lock,
the sync prints a notice, and the next `bun run sync` aligns the committed lock
through the release flow below.

The synchronization command:

1. reads the public stable-channel manifest used by ZCode Desktop, with the
   static CDN manifest as a fallback only when the service response is
   unavailable or invalid;
2. downloads the matching installer;
3. verifies its SHA-512 from the manifest;
4. extracts `resources/glm`;
5. applies the version-independent runtime patch plan and injects the local
   `@zcode/tui` adapter, retaining upstream text and marking the runtime as modified;
6. extracts the strict global CLI option contract and validates the official
   CLI version;
7. records provenance, CLI capabilities and each patch result in
   `vendor/extraction.json`;
8. records the remote artifact URL and SHA-512 in
   `zcode-runtime.lock.json`;
9. aligns the npm version prefix with the ZCode App version while preserving
   the independently incremented CLI build revision.

## npm package contents

The published package is controlled by the `files` allowlist in `package.json`.
It contains only:

- `bin/zcode.js`, the bundled executable Node.js launcher;
- `vendor/`, the extracted and patched `zcode.cjs` runtime, included built-in
  plugins (including document, PDF, presentation and spreadsheet plugins with
  their original licenses) and the compiled local `@zcode/tui` adapter;
- `setting.example.json`, `provider.example.json` and `zcode-runtime.lock.json`;
- the English and Simplified Chinese configuration guides and provider field
  references in `docs/`;
- `docs/THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT.md` and the license texts, upstream notices and
  source provenance in `LICENSES/`;
- `README.md`, `LICENSE` and the required npm `package.json`.

Tests, GitHub workflows, build scripts, launcher/TUI TypeScript sources, local
config, `.release/` artifacts and development `node_modules` are not published.
npm installs the declared pi-tui and `playwright-core` dependencies. The launcher and TUI
are compiled to JavaScript with `tsdown`; its launcher banner adds the Node.js
shebang directly, with no post-build rewrite. The compiled TUI is injected into
`vendor/` before publication.

## Commit preview packages

`.github/workflows/release-commit.yml` builds previews for pull requests, pushes
to `main`, and manual workflow runs. It checks out the PR's head commit, builds
the locked runtime, runs the release checks, and install-tests the npm tarball.
The exact tested tarball is uploaded to pkg.pr.new without repacking it.

Install the [pkg-pr-new GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/pkg-pr-new) on this
repository before the first preview publication. No npm token or npm publish
permission is needed. The publisher is pinned in `devDependencies` and `bun.lock`.

The app updates a PR comment with a commit-specific preview link. The workflow
summary also gives the command to test an existing session:

```bash
npx --yes https://pkg.pr.new/zcode-app-cli@<commit-sha> --resume <session-id>
```

Use the exact URL emitted by the successful workflow. This runs the preview
without replacing the globally installed CLI. It uses the user's normal session
store, so the tester can verify their affected sessions. Record the preview URL
with the test result: preview tarballs retain the source package version, while
their URLs identify the commit. They do not update npm's `latest` tag or create
a release tag. The tested tarball is also retained as a workflow artifact for
14 days, including when pkg.pr.new publication fails.

## Versioning

Starting with `v26.9.23`, package versions and release tags use calendar
versioning: `<year>.<month>.<day>`, tagged `v<version>` as before (for example
`v26.9.23`). This operator-ordered calver scheme replaces the earlier
`<app-version>-<build>` scheme, whose last release was `3.14.1-27`. The
upstream ZCode App version is no longer encoded in the package version: it
stays decoupled, recorded in `zcode-runtime.lock.json` (`appVersion`) and in
`vendor/extraction.json` (`appVersion`, `cliVersion`).

Under the retired scheme the prefix tracked the upstream ZCode App and a
globally increasing build revision tracked fixes and features in this project
(`bun run version:build` incremented it). That build-revision increment belongs
to the retired scheme; do not use `+build` SemVer metadata either way, because
SemVer ignores it when comparing upgrades. The in-tree prepare workflow still
carries the increment for legacy `<app-version>-<build>` maintenance; calver
releases take their version from the release date instead.

## Release flow

Publishing is split into two workflows so the committed version, npm package,
Git tag and GitHub Release all describe the same release:

1. `.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml` extracts and validates the current
   official runtime, then opens or updates a Release PR containing the exact
   `package.json` version and `zcode-runtime.lock.json` build input;
2. a maintainer reviews and merges that PR;
3. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` checks out its merge commit, rebuilds the
   exact locked runtime, audits and install-tests the tarball, publishes through
   npm Trusted Publishing, then creates `v<version>` and the corresponding
   GitHub Release.

The generated `vendor/` directory remains ignored by Git and is rebuilt in both
workflows. Its updater URL and SHA-512 are committed in
`zcode-runtime.lock.json`. Preparation resolves the latest manifest; publishing
downloads the committed URL and verifies the locked SHA-512, so a later upstream
update cannot silently change a reviewed release.

The scheduled workflow follows the Desktop stable channel (`channel=1`) without
credentials or a personal `device_mid`. Static `latest-*.yml` files can lag the
service and are therefore recovery inputs, not the primary update signal. If
upstream rolls its stable channel back, synchronization keeps a newer committed
lock instead of silently downgrading it; adopting a rollback requires an
explicit maintainer review of `zcode-runtime.lock.json`.

The preparation workflow checks upstream once per day at 01:30 in the
`Asia/Shanghai` timezone, in `upstream` mode. [GitHub documents scheduled
triggers as best effort](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule):
under high Actions load a scheduled event can still be delayed or dropped. The
preparation itself is idempotent:
the fixed release branch is created or updated only when the runtime lock or
package version changes. A same-version upstream repack increments the global
build so npm still receives an immutable new version. From the Actions page,
run **Prepare ZCode CLI release** with one of these modes:

- `cli` increments the global build and also aligns with the latest App;
- `upstream` checks for an App update without incrementing the build.

The modes use `release/zcode-cli` and `release/zcode-upstream` respectively. If
both PRs are open, merge one and rerun the other preparation mode so its version
is recalculated from the new `main` branch.

Runtime patches are registered as `required` or `optional`. Required bridge,
OAuth, HTTP and public CLI contract failures stop preparation. Optional
diagnostics and presentation fixes record a `skipped` capability and allow the
validated runtime to continue. Session cache aggregation lives in the local TUI
and reads persisted messages through the adapter, so upstream minifier symbol
changes do not affect it.

If a required compatibility check fails, synchronization writes JSON and
Markdown reports under `.release/`. The scheduled workflow uploads both files
and creates or updates the fixed **Automated upstream runtime compatibility
failure** issue. A later successful scheduled validation closes that issue.
This separates an upstream incompatibility from download, checksum, permission
and publishing failures without weakening the release gate. Discovery failures
are still uploaded for diagnosis, but they do not create a compatibility issue.

The workflow also runs a least-privilege keepalive job on scheduled events. It
calls [GitHub's workflow-enable API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows#enable-a-workflow)
instead of creating dummy commits, which prevents the public-repository 60-day
inactivity rule from disabling this schedule. This cannot eliminate
platform-wide outages or dropped events; for a hard delivery deadline, use an
external scheduler or run the workflow manually:

```bash
gh workflow run prepare-release.yml --ref main -f kind=upstream
gh workflow enable prepare-release.yml
```

Merging either Release PR publishes automatically. **Publish ZCode CLI
release** can also be started manually for recovery. Its `publish` checkbox can
be disabled to run all validation and consistency checks without changing npm,
Git tags or GitHub Releases. Publication, tag creation and GitHub Release
creation are independently idempotent, so a partially completed run can be
retried safely.

## Local release build

Local packaging uses the same commands as the publishing workflow. Start from
the exact clean commit whose version will be published:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run release:build
git diff --exit-code -- package.json zcode-runtime.lock.json
bun run release:pack
```

`release:build` runs TypeScript checking and all tests, downloads the artifact
from `zcode-runtime.lock.json`, verifies its SHA-512, builds and injects the TUI,
then runs runtime and PTY smoke tests. `release:pack` runs the offline
`prepack` guard, creates `.release/zcode-app-cli-<version>.tgz`, audits every
included path and executable mode, installs it into a temporary directory, and
runs the installed `zcode --version`. It also checks the runtime modification
notice and initializes the included plugins using an isolated temporary home,
verifying that Browser Use and the four document plugins are enabled and their
original license files are present. Installation is limited to three minutes,
the version check to 15 seconds, and plugin initialization to 30 seconds;
timed-out checks terminate their subprocesses before cleanup. Only after all
checks pass are the final size, integrity and file count written to
`.release/release.json`.

Inspect that manifest and then publish explicitly:

```bash
npm login
npm publish --access public --tag latest --provenance=false
```

The final `npm publish` intentionally remains explicit to avoid an accidental
registry mutation. It reruns the same offline `prepack` guard and fails if the
compiled TUI, runtime provenance, lock file, launcher permissions or package
allowlist are stale. `--provenance=false` applies only to this local bootstrap
path; GitHub OIDC generates provenance automatically.

Publish from the repository root as shown, rather than passing the `.tgz` to
`npm publish`: directory publication lets npm record the current Git `gitHead`,
which the recovery workflow later verifies. The tarball is the audited preview
and install-test artifact.

## Initial npm setup

If the package does not exist on npm yet, bootstrap it once from the exact
committed `main` revision using the local release build above. If its Git diff
check fails, do not publish from that working tree; refresh the Release PR or
restore the committed version and lock first.

Synchronization preserves the build when the upstream App version changes. For
example, syncing `3.3.5-12` against ZCode App `3.4.0` produces `3.4.0-12`.

Before enabling publication:

1. confirm that `zcode-app-cli` is the npm package name you control;
2. review the licenses of the selected Desktop artifact and its dependencies.
   The public first-party source is Apache-2.0, but its source revision is not
   the provenance record for the extracted binary. Keep the license and copied
   notices in `LICENSES/`, the runtime modification notice, and the artifact
   metadata. The four document-related plugins are included in this project's
   non-commercial distribution with their original skill license files. See
   [Third-party content](./THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT.md);
3. under the GitHub repository's **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**,
   enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**;
4. open the package on npmjs.com and select **Settings** →
   **Trusted Publisher** → **GitHub Actions**;
5. enter the GitHub organization or user, repository, and workflow filename
   `publish.yml`; leave the environment name empty because this
   workflow does not use a GitHub Environment, and select `npm publish` under
   **Allowed actions**;
6. save the publisher, prepare a `cli` release, and merge its Release PR to
   verify an OIDC publication.

The publisher runs on a GitHub-hosted runner with Node 24, grants
`id-token: write`, and updates npm to the current release. It never reads an
`NPM_TOKEN` repository secret; npm attaches provenance from the OIDC identity.
After verifying the first OIDC release, npm recommends setting **Publishing
access** to require 2FA and disallow tokens, then revoking any obsolete
automation token.

The publisher skips an identical existing version, refuses older versions,
verifies every existing npm release's `gitHead`, and refuses to reuse a tag
that points at another commit. The `latest` dist-tag therefore advances only
to the newest validated App-plus-build release.
